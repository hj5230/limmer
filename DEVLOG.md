# TODO
- Heuristic check it the LLM response is legitimate (is there any space between characters)
- **Completion** Track cursor position within the textarea (maybe not using textarea at all)
- **Complition** Don't block the user from typing when the LLM is thinking (queue the requests)
- **Completion** Define 2 set of prompts, one for complete current word (if previous input was a charactor) and one for guess the next word (if previous input was a space)
